# Parameter-redundancy-VQE

The repository contains codes and data used in the article [Parameter Redundancy in the Unitary Coupled-Cluster Ansatze for Hybrid Variational Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.09825.pdf)

The directory "Data" contains all the data needed to genarate the figures given in the article. It has been divided into subdirectories ML Data and Pre ML Data which contain data required to generate figures corresponding to ML algorithm and Pre ML (or non ML) algorithm respectively. These subdirectories have been further divided according to the figure index and they inturn contain the data required to generate those figures.

The file "small_amplitude_filtration.ipynb" is the code used in the article to perform small amplitude filtration and spin adaption. The file contains further directions its usage.
